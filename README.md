# Wazuh Cloud SIEM Lab Project

This project documents my hands-on experience with deploying a cloud-based SIEM using [Wazuh Cloud](https://wazuh.com/cloud/). I connected a Windows machine as an agent and monitored security events via the Wazuh dashboards.

## 🌐 Overview

- ✅ Wazuh Cloud instance provisioned
- ✅ Windows agent installed and connected
- ✅ Real-time log monitoring configured
- ✅ Dashboards explored for:
  - Security events
  - File integrity monitoring
  - Agent health
  - MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Wazuh Cloud**
- **Wazuh Windows Agent**
- **Windows 10/11**
